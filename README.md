Changelog:

- WUWS 1.3

Hopefully, the last version of WUWS. Attempt to start works on rebranding to NHWS. Remove credits, cookie notice (I don't have a net neutrality notice on this page anymore), I think Google Analytics was removed long ago.

These commits are horrible... but either way, I have some work to do!

- WUWS 1.2

Added Homebrew Launcher 1.3 support. 5.5.1 support is complete.

- WUWS 1.1

Legitimately added 5.5.2 support. Added from a suggestion on our [GBATemp page](https://gbatemp.net/threads/wuws-just-another-way-to-access-homebrew.495989/) - "Literally just a badly made github pages site with redirects to stupiid payloads. Useless." Posted by [Create_](https://gbatemp.net/members/create_.427071/)
